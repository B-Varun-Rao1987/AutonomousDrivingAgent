# AutonomousDrivingAgent

"Autonomous Driving Agent" as a visual simulation prototype aims to develop a virtual simulation of an autonomous driving system. The simulation will showcase the capabilities of autonomous driving technology, allowing viewers to see how the system reacts to real-world scenarios and makes decisions in real-time.
The project will utilize computer graphics, software engineering, concepts of ray tracing, some soft computing concepts and making its way to human-computer interaction to develop a functional prototype of the autonomous driving system in further versions. The visual simulation will be designed to mimic real-world scenarios, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to showcase the capabilities of autonomous driving technology without the need for physical hardware.
The project is expected to provide valuable insights into the development of autonomous driving systems, including the development of decision-making algorithms and sensor technologies. The simulation prototype will also provide an opportunity for students to gain practical experience in developing complex software systems, improving their skills in software engineering, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction.
Overall, the "Autonomous Driving Agent" visual simulation prototype has the aim to present a potential to have a significant impact on the transportation industry in upcoming versions and refining the basic idea of project so to demonstrating the capabilities of autonomous driving technology and provide a valuable tool for testing and development. The project will let us understand the potential of autonomous driving systems to reduce accidents and improve transportation efficiency, paving the way for the future of transport system and then find the shortcomings of this project and thereby try to understand the final outcome of this particular idea how it should like, whether a hybrid system would be beneficial of let alone.
